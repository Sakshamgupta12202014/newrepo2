		<h2 style="font-size:40px;color: red;">Introduction To National Parks Of India</h2>
		<h2>A national park is a natural park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected
			by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land
			that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks 
			differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride
			<br>There are 106 existing national parks in India covering an area of 44,378 km2 (17,134 sq mi), which is 1.35% of the
			geographical area of the country (National Wildlife Database, Dec. 2020). In addition to the above, 75 other National 
			Parks covering an area of 16,608 km2 (6,412 sq mi) are proposed in the Protected Area Network Report.
			The network of parks will go up 176 after full implementation of the above report.
			Hemis National Park is largest national park with an area 4,400 km² of while South Button Island National Park is 
			smallest with an area of just 5.19 km².
			<br><br><br>According to the Indian Ministry of Environment & Forests, a national park is "[a]n area, 
			whether within a sanctuary or not, [that] can be notified by the state government to be constituted as a National Park, 
			by reason of its ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, or zoological association or importance, needed to for the 
			purpose of protecting & propagating or developing wildlife there in or its environment. No human activity is permitted 
			inside the national park except for the ones permitted by the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state under the conditions 
			given in CHAPTER IV, WPA 1972".[1]
			<br><br>
			<br>India is home to a rich diversity of flora and fauna, and the country's national parks play an important role in 
			protecting and preserving this natural heritage. Some of the most well-known national parks in India include Kaziranga 
			National Park in Assam, which is home to two-thirds of the world's one-horned rhinoceros population, and Kanha National 
			Park in Madhya Pradesh, which is said to have inspired Rudyard Kipling's classic novel, The Jungle Book. Other popular 
			national parks in India include Bandhavgarh National Park<br>
			<br>
			<br>Ranthambore National Park, and Jim Corbett National Park, all of which are known for their tigers. India has a total 
			of 104 national parks, spread across 31 states and union territories, covering an area of over 40,500 square kilometers. 
			These parks provide a wide range of opportunities for nature lovers, from wildlife safaris and bird watching to hiking and 
			camping. They also play a crucial role in promoting conservation and sustainable tourism in the country.
			<br>
			<!-- <br>Addressing air pollution requires a range of solutions, including policy and regulation, technological
			innovation, and public awareness campaigns. Governments can regulate emissions from vehicles, industries,
			and power plants, as well as promote the use of cleaner fuels and renewable energy sources. Technological
			innovation can also play a role in reducing air pollution, such as the development of cleaner engines and
			more efficient energy production. Finally, public awareness campaigns can help educate people about the
			impacts
			of air pollution and encourage them to take action to reduce their own emissions.


			<br>
			<br>In conclusion, air pollution is a significant environmental issue that has far-reaching impacts on
			human health and the environment. The sources of air pollution are numerous and varied, and addressing
			the problem requires a range of solutions. By working together to reduce air pollution, we can improve
			the health of our planet and ensure a more sustainable future for all.

		<h1 style="font-size:40px;color: red;">Importance of National Parks in India for Conservation and Ecotourism</h1><br>

		<h2>
			<p style="color: rgb(22, 22, 174);font-size: 20px;">National Parks in India play a crucial role in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and ecological resources. These protected areas provide a sanctuary for a wide range of endangered and threatened species, including tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, and many more. They also serve as important habitats for migratory birds and other wildlife. The conservation efforts within these parks have helped to maintain the ecological balance and preserve the natural heritage of the country.
<br><br><br>
				In addition to their conservation importance, national parks in India also play a vital role in promoting ecotourism. They provide visitors with opportunities to experience and appreciate the beauty of nature while also learning about the importance of conservation. Ecotourism generates revenue for local communities and helps to create awareness about the value of preserving these natural habitats. It also promotes sustainable development, as the revenue generated from ecotourism is reinvested in the conservation and management of these parks.
				<br><br><br>
				Overall, the importance of national parks in India for conservation and ecotourism cannot be overstated. They serve as critical habitats for a diverse range of plant and animal species, while also providing visitors with unique experiences that promote awareness and appreciation of nature. The continued protection and conservation of these parks are essential for preserving India's rich biodiversity and ecological resources for future generations.

		<p style="color: rgb(22, 22, 174);font-size: 15px;">National parks in India face several challenges in their conservation efforts. 
			Here are some of the major challenges faced by National Parks in India:
		</p>

		<h2>
			<ul>

				<li>Human-Wildlife Conflict: National parks in India are home to a wide range of wildlife species. 
					With increasing human populations, encroachment, and habitat destruction, wildlife often ventures 
					into human settlements leading to conflict. This conflict can lead to injury or death of both humans and animals
					, leading to a negative attitude towards wildlife conservation.</li><br>
				<li>Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade: Poaching and illegal wildlife trade are one of the biggest challenges faced
					by national parks in India. India is home to some of the world's most endangered species like tigers, elephants, 
					and rhinos, which are targeted by poachers for their valuable body parts and skin.</li><br>
				<li>Habitat Destruction: Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion have led to the destruction of natural habitats, 
					which is one of the major threats to wildlife conservation. Deforestation, land-use change, mining, and other developmental 
					activities have caused irreversible damage to ecosystems..</li><br>
				<li>Climate Change: Climate change is a global phenomenon that poses a significant threat to biodiversity. Rising temperatures, 
					changing rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events are affecting the distribution, behavior, and survival of many species.
				</li><br>
				<li>Lack of Resources: National parks face a shortage of resources, including funding, manpower, and infrastructure. This can hinder 
					their conservation efforts and limit their ability to protect wildlife and their habitats.
				</li><br>

		<a id="why"></a>
		<h1>Initiatives Taken for the Development and Management of National Parks in India</h1>

		<h2></h2>
		<p>AIndia followed the “preservationism” model for biodiversity conservation during the initial establishment 
			of protected areas, but it resulted in increased conflicts with local people. In order to buffer conflicts of the local people, India was 
			the first country to introduce the concept of “Joint Forest Management” in its National Forest Policy, 1988, which has the provision of 
			involving the local communities for sustainable conservation and management of forests. Thus, there is a shifting paradigm from “preservationism” to “sustainable
			use” approach during the recent times. This approach is managing forest resources with varying degrees of success by taking care of community needs and aspirations 
			for the past 30 years. Although rural communities and forest officers are developing a positive attitude toward forest conservation, there are still some concerns like the 
			functioning of forest committee, the role of women, freedom of working, and participatory approach in forest conservation and management.</p><br>

		<h2>1.Conservation</h2>

		<p>
			The human-wildlife conflict was one of the major challenges for the conservation of species within protected areas. The government of India launched the eco-development project in the 1990s, to minimize such conflicts and effective conservation. In order to promote human security and protecting biodiversity simultaneously, the government of India introduced financial compensation as a policy against human-wildlife conflicts around the protected areas of the country. Similarly, some compensation incentives are instituted in Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) in response to crop damage, livestock, or human injuries caused by wildlife in protected areas. For example, crop loss due to wildlife is compensated by providing equivalent incentives under the “grain-for-grain” scheme in Pakke Tiger Reserve and northeast states of India [35]. Similarly, active bio-fences consisting of beehives or defensive crops (with pungent smell and thorns) were used to keep away elephants and other wild animals in Kaziranga National Park of Assam..</p><br>

		<h2>2.Resource use </h2>

		<p>
			Often resource use in many protected areas of the country is banned or restricted. According to the Supreme Court orders (dated 14.02.2000 and 21.02.2000 in I.A. No. 548 in WP No. 202/1995), the removal of dead, diseased, dying, or wind-fallen trees, driftwood, and grasses, etc. is restrained from any national park or game sanctuary [36]. This develops conflicts among the local people and forest officials, which is one of the major challenges for sustainability in protected areas. Later, the Government of India enacted the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, with provisions to acknowledge rights within forests including within protected areas. Until recently, bamboo has been considered as a “tree” in the country under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and its felling and transit required prior permission from the forest department. However, a recent amendment has taken out bamboo from the category of “trees,” and now local farmers can freely cultivate and harvest bamboo..</p><br>
